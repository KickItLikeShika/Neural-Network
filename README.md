# Neural Network

This repository contains the python implementation of Neural Network using Froward propagation and back propagation.

Applied the neural network on two different problems (Regression problem, Classification problem)


## Requirements 

These models has been tested and developed using the following libraries: 

    - python==3.8.2
    - numpy==1.13.3

    
I recommend using at least these versions of the required libraries or later. Python 2 is not supported. 
 

## Caveats and tips

-  In `numpy`, the function `dot` is used to perform matrix multiplication. The operation '*' only does element-by-element multiplication. If you are using python version 3.5+, the operator '@' is the new matrix multiplication, and it is equivalent to the `dot` function.
